# Quick Fix: Bypass Age Verification

## Your Site IS Working!

The site is loading correctly - you're seeing the Age Verification page as designed.

## Option 1: Complete Age Verification (Recommended)

1. Enter birth date: `1990-01-01` (or any date that makes you 18+)
2. Click "I am 18+ - Enter Paradise"
3. You'll see the login page
4. Login with: `admin@nocturne.com` + any password

## Option 2: Temporary Bypass for Testing

If you want to skip age verification during development, edit the App.tsx file to start directly on the Auth page instead of AgeVerification.

## What You Should See Next

After age verification:
✅ **Login/Register page**
✅ **Main app with stories** (after login)
✅ **Admin panel** (if logged in as admin)

## Your App Flow

1. **Age Verification** ← You are here
2. **Login/Register** ← Next step
3. **Main App** ← Final destination

**Just enter a birth date and click the button - your app is working perfectly!**
