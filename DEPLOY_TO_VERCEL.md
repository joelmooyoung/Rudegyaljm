# Deploy Rude Gyal Confessions to Vercel

## Quick Start (5-10 minutes)

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "Add New Project"**
4. **Import your GitHub repository** (the one containing this code)
5. **Configure settings** (should auto-detect):
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/spa`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In the Vercel dashboard, before deploying, add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV = production
JWT_SECRET = your_super_secure_jwt_secret_make_it_very_long_and_random_123456789
```

### 4. Deploy!

1. **Click "Deploy"**
2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the build
3. **Get your live URL**: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## What You'll Get

✅ **Live URL**: Something like `https://rude-gyal-confessions-xyz.vercel.app`
✅ **Automatic HTTPS**: SSL certificate included
✅ **Global CDN**: Fast loading worldwide
✅ **Auto-deployments**: Updates automatically when you push to GitHub

## Testing Your Live App

Once deployed, test these features:

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Login/Register functionality works
- [ ] Story browsing works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible (if you're logged in as admin)
- [ ] All styling and animations work
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Current Limitation

**Note**: This deployment includes only the frontend. The backend API (authentication, story management) is currently using mock data and won't persist between sessions. For a fully functional app, you'll need to:

1. Deploy the backend API separately (to Railway, Render, or Vercel Functions)
2. Set up a real database (PostgreSQL on Supabase)
3. Update API endpoints to point to your live backend

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Share your live URL** - show off your app!
2. **Test thoroughly** - make sure everything works
3. **Plan backend deployment** - when ready for full functionality
4. **Add custom domain** - when `rudegyaljm.com` is ready

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**

- Check that `npm run build` works locally
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json

**App loads but features don't work?**

- This is expected - backend needs separate deployment

**Want full functionality?**

- Let me know and I can help set up backend deployment!
