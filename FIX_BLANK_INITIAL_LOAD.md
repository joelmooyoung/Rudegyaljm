# Fix Blank Page on Initial Site Load

## Problem

The site shows a blank page when first loaded (before login), even though it worked fine before Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the **React app mounting structure**:

1. `index.html` was trying to load `/client/App.tsx` directly
2. This doesn't work in production because Vite bundles the TypeScript into JavaScript
3. The app wasn't mounting properly, causing a blank page

## Solution

✅ **Created proper entry point**: `client/main.tsx`
✅ **Fixed index.html**: Now points to `client/main.tsx`
✅ **Separated concerns**: App.tsx is now just the component, main.tsx handles DOM mounting
✅ **Fixed CSS import**: Using correct `global.css` path

## Deploy the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix blank page on initial load - proper React mounting structure"
git push origin main
```

## What I Changed

### 1. Created `/client/main.tsx`

- Proper React 18 mounting with createRoot
- Imports App component
- Handles CSS imports

### 2. Updated `/index.html`

- Changed from `/client/App.tsx` to `/client/main.tsx`
- Now works with Vite build process

### 3. Updated `/client/App.tsx`

- Removed DOM mounting logic
- Now just exports the App component
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Expected Result

After deployment, when you visit https://rudegyaljm.vercel.app/:

✅ **Site loads immediately** (no more blank page)
✅ **Age verification page appears** with proper styling
✅ **React app mounts correctly**
✅ **All functionality works** as it did locally

## Test Flow

1. Visit: https://rudegyaljm.vercel.app/
2. Should immediately see age verification page (not blank)
3. Complete age verification or click "Skip for Testing"
4. Login with: `admin@nocturne.com` + any password
5. Access full app functionality

## Why This Happened

- **Local development**: Vite dev server can handle TypeScript directly
- **Production build**: Needs proper entry point structure
- **Vercel deployment**: Serves the built files, not raw TypeScript

**This fix ensures the React app mounts properly in production!**
