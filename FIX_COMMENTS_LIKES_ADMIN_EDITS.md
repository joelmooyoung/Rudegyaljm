fetch("/api/stories/1/comments", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    comment: "Great story!",
    username: "TestUser",
    userId: "test-123",
  }),
})
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then(console.log);

// Test toggling like
fetch("/api/stories/1/like", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: "test-123" }),
})
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then(console.log);

// Test rating
fetch("/api/stories/1/rating", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: "test-123", rating: 5 }),
})
  .then((r) => r.json())

## Data Persistence Note

Currently using in-memory storage for demo purposes. In production, these would connect to a real database for permanent persistence.

**All user interactions (comments, likes, ratings) and admin edits should now work perfectly!**
