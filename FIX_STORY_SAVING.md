# Fix Story Saving Issues

## Problem

Stories are not saving when you create new ones or edit existing ones in the admin panel.

## Root Cause

The frontend was calling `/api/stories` for save operations, but that endpoint was read-only. I've now updated it to handle both reading and writing.

## What I Fixed

✅ **Updated `/api/stories.js`** - Now handles POST (create) and PUT (update) operations
✅ **Added debugging logs** - You can see what's happening in the console
✅ **Added missing endpoints** - `/api/stories/[id]/publish` for publishing stories
✅ **Better error handling** - More detailed error messages

## Deploy the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix story saving - complete CRUD API for stories"
git push origin main
```

## Test Story Management After Deployment

### 1. Create New Story

1. Login as admin (`admin@nocturne.com` + any password)
2. Go to Admin → Story Maintenance
3. Click "Add New Story"
4. Fill in all fields:
   - Title: "Test Story"
   - Author: "Test Author"
   - Excerpt: "This is a test story"
   - Content: "Full content here"
   - Category: "Romance"
   - Access Level: "free"
   - Tags: "test, new"
5. Click "Save Story"
6. Should see success message and story appears in list

### 2. Edit Existing Story

1. Click "Edit" on any existing story
2. Change the title or content
3. Click "Save Story"
4. Should see updated content

### 3. Publish/Unpublish

1. Click "Publish" or "Unpublish" toggle
2. Should see status change immediately

## Debug Information

After deployment, check the browser console (F12) for detailed logs:

- `[STORY CREATE] Request body:` - Shows what data is being sent
- `[STORY CREATE] Success! New story ID:` - Confirms creation worked
- `[STORY UPDATE] Updating story:` - Shows update attempts
- `[STORY UPDATE] Success! Updated story:` - Confirms updates worked

## Expected Results

✅ **New stories save** and appear in the story list
✅ **Edited stories update** with your changes
✅ **Publish status toggles** work correctly
✅ **All story fields persist** (title, content, tags, etc.)

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check browser console** for API errors
2. **Test API directly**: Visit `/api/stories` to see if stories load
3. **Check Network tab** for failed POST/PUT requests

**The story saving functionality should now work completely!**
