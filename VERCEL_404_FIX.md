# Fix Vercel 404 Error - Emergency Guide

## Current Situation

The React app IS working (content is loading), but Vercel is showing a 404 error overlay. This is a **routing configuration issue** on Vercel's side.

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Deploy Updated Vercel Config

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing for SPA"
git push origin main
```

### Fix 2: Test Static File Serving

After deployment, test this URL:

```
https://rudegyaljm.vercel.app/test.html
```

If this shows "Test page working!", then static files work and it's a routing issue.

### Fix 3: Vercel Dashboard Fix

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Functions
4. Make sure "Framework Preset" is set to **Vite**
5. Check "Build Command" is `npm run build`
6. Check "Output Directory" is `dist/spa`

### Fix 4: Manual Redeploy

In Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "..." on latest deployment
3. Select "Redeploy"
4. Choose "Use existing Build Cache" = **NO**
5. Click "Redeploy"

### Fix 5: Alternative Vercel Config

If the above doesn't work, try this in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

## Root Cause

The React app is actually working (you can see the age verification content in the DOM), but Vercel's routing isn't properly serving the SPA. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications on Vercel.

## Expected Result

After fixing, you should:
✅ See the age verification page (no 404)
✅ Be able to proceed through the app
✅ No Vercel error overlay

## If Nothing Works

As a last resort, try deploying to:

- **Netlify** (often handles SPAs better)
- **GitHub Pages** with proper routing
- **Railway** or **Render**

The app code is working - it's just a hosting configuration issue!
